# Allowance Punchcard

Simple fun UI to set up a weekly punchard. User populates a grid with the items they are trying to limit intake of, like burgrers, pizza, booze. Say I am setting a rule to only have one burger a week, 4 beers, and 2  cigarettes. You just type in the vices and number allowed that week, and app outputs a styleized punch card so when you cash in your cheat days, you punch it. Really make the UI expressive with sound and feedback, really feel like a satisfying ka-chunk when punchin off an item.
That's mainly it, but it can extend to have ongoing record, view your stats and review progress over the weeeks. add in more gameified whatevers, but MVP is pretty simple, and mainly a good UX challenge.
